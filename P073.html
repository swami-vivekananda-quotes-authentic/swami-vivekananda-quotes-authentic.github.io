"Every man should take up his own ideal and endeavour to accomplish it. That is a surer way of progress than taking up other men's ideals, which he can never hope to accomplish. For instance, we take a child and at once give him the task of walking twenty miles. Either the little one dies, or one in a thousand crawls the twenty miles, to reach the end exhausted and half-dead. That is like what we generally try to do with the world. All the men and women, in any society, are not of the same mind, capacity, or of the same power to do things; they must have different ideals, and we have no right to sneer at any ideal. Let every one do the best he can for realising his own ideal. Nor is it right that I should be judged by your standard or you by mine...To judge the apple tree you must take the apple standard, and for the oak [tree], its own standard."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Each Is Great in His Own Place" (Advanced karma yoga class, Dec 13, 1895, New York Vedanta Society), Karma Yoga, Complete Works: Vol 1
