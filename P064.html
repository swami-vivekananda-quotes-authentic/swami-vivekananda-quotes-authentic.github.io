"My old master used to say, "When the lotus of the heart has bloomed, the bees will come by themselves." Men like that are there yet. They need not talk. ... When the man is perfect from his heart, without a thought of hatred, all animals will give up their hatred [before him]. So with purity. These are necessary for our dealings with our fellow beings. We must love all. ... We have no business to look at the faults of others: it does no good. We must not even think of them. Our business is with the good. We are not here to deal with faults. Our business is to be good."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Concentration" (March 16, 1900, Washington Hall, San Francisco)[recorded by Ida Ansell], Lectures and Discourses, Complete Works: Vol 4
