"It is the most difficult thing in this world to work and not care for the result, to help a man and never think that he ought to be grateful, to do some good work and at the same time never look to see whether it brings you name or fame, or nothing at all. Even the most arrant coward becomes brave when the world praises him. A fool can do heroic deeds when the approbation of society is upon him, but for a man to constantly do good without caring for the approbation of his fellow men is indeed the highest sacrifice man can perform."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Each Is Great in His Own Place" (Advanced karma yoga class, Dec 13, 1895, New York Vedanta Society), Karma Yoga, Complete Works: Vol 1
