"If there is a method by which we can analyse, investigate, understand, and finally grapple with those finer powers [of mind], the finer causes, then alone is it possible to have control over ourselves, and the man who has control over his own mind assuredly will have control over every other mind. That is why purity and morality have been always the object of religion; a pure, moral man has control of himself. And all minds are the same, different parts of one Mind. He who knows one lump of clay has known all the clay in the universe. He who knows and controls his own mind knows the secret of every mind and has power over every mind."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "The Powers of the Mind" (Jan 8, 1900, Los Angeles), Complete Works: Vol 2
