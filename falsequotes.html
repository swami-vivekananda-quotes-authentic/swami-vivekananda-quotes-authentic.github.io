(arranged alphabetically)

<ul>
<li> A monk of the RamaKrishna Mission was being interviewed by a journalist from NY. The journalist started interviewing the monk as planned earlier.

Journalist - "Sir, in your last lecture, you mentioned Jogajog (contact) & Sanjog (connection). It is really confusing. Could you please explain?"

The monk smiled and apparently deviating from the question asked the journalist: 
"Are you from New York?"
Journalist - "Yeh"
Monk - "Please tell me about your family."
.......
You have 'contact' with your father but you don't have a 'connection' with him. In fact you are not connected to him in any way. Connection is heart to heart, sitting together, sharing meals and caring for each other, touching, shaking hands, having eye contact, spending some time together. You brothers and sisters may 'contact' you but there is no 'connection' with each other."
The journalist wiped his eyes and said : "Thanks for teaching me an unforgettable lesson."</li>

<li> If I love myself despite my infinite faults, how can I hate anyone at the glimpse of a few faults.  </li>

<li> If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader </li>

<li> If we both exchange one rupee, we have one rupee. But if we both exchange one good thoughts we have two good thoughts. </li>

<li> Mind is not a dustbin to keep anger, hatred and jealousy. But it is the treasure box to keep love, happiness and sweet memories. </li>

<li> People with good intentions makes promises but people with good character keeps them. </li>

<li> Positive people also have negative thoughts. They just don't allow those thoughts to control them. </li>

<li> Sharing your feelings is not a sign of weakness. It shows you have the strength to trust someone completely. </li>

<li> Silence tells more sometimes than all the speech in the world. </li>

<li> The struggle your'e in today is developing the strength you need for tomorrow. </li>

<li> What people think about you is not important. What you think about yourself means everything. </li>

<li> When someone is rude, keep a smile on your face. When you keep your joy, you take away their power. </li>

<li> With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts. </li>
