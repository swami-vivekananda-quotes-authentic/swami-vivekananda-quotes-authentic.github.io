"Man is an infinite circle whose circumference is nowhere, but the centre is located in one spot; and God is an infinite circle whose circumference is nowhere, but whose centre is everywhere. He works through all hands, sees through all eyes, walks on all feet, breathes through all bodies, lives in all life, speaks through every mouth, and thinks through every brain. Man can become like God and acquire control over the whole universe if he multiplies infinitely his centre of self-consciousness. Consciousness, therefore, is the chief thing to understand."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Hints on Practical Spirituality" (Spiritual Breathing, Dec 29, 1899, Los Angeles Home of Truth), Complete Works: Vol 2
