"All over the world there has been the belief in the supernatural throughout the ages. All of us have heard of extraordinary happenings, and many of us have had some personal experience of them... Well, I saw many things like that. Going about India you find hundreds of similar things in different places. These are in every country. Even in this country [USA] you will find some such wonderful things. Of course there is a great deal of fraud, no doubt; but then, whenever you see fraud, you have also to say that fraud is an imitation. There must be some truth somewhere, that is being imitated; you cannot imitate nothing. Imitation must be of something substantially true."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "The Powers of the Mind" (Jan 8, 1900, Los Angeles), Complete Works: Vol 2
