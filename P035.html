"The beggar is never happy. The beggar only gets a dole with pity and scorn behind it, at least with the thought behind that the beggar is a low object. He never really enjoys what he gets. We are all beggars. Whatever we do, we want a return. We are all traders. We are traders in life, we are traders in virtue, we are traders in religion. And alas! we are also traders in love. If you come to trade, if it is a question of give-and-take, if it is a question of buy-and-sell, abide by the laws of buying and selling. There is a bad time and there is a good time... always you expect the blow to come."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Work and Its Secret" (What Brings Success, Jan 4, 1900, Los Angeles, Complete Works: Vol 2)
