<meta property="og:description" content="This idea of "me and mine" - Ahamk&acircra and Mamat&acirc - is the result of past Superstition, and the more this present self passes away, the more the real Self becomes manifest. This is true self-abnegation, the centre, the basis, the gist of all moral teaching; and whether man knows it or not the whole world is slowly going towards it, practicing it more or less. Only, the vast majority of mankind are doing it unconsciously. Let them do it consciously. Let then make the sacrifice, knowing that this "me and mine" is not the real Self, but only a limitation. But one glimpse of that infinite reality which is behind - but one spark of that infinite fire that is the All - represents the present man; the Infinite is his true nature." />
