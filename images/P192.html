<meta property="og:description" content="Here are two Sanskrit words. The one is Pravritti, which means revolving towards, and the other is Nivritti, which means revolving away. The "revolving towards" is what we call the world, the "I and mine”; it includes all those things which are always enriching that "me" by wealth and money and power, and name and fame, and which are of a grasping nature, always tending to accumulate everything in one center, that center being "myself". That is the Pravritti, the natural tendency of every human being; taking everything from everywhere and heaping it around one center, that center being man's own sweet self. When this tendency begins to break, when it is Nivritti or "going away from," then begin morality and religion...This Nivritti is the fundamental basis of all morality and all religion." />
