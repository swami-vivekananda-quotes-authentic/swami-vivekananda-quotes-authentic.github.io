<meta property="og:description" content="The whole universe, therefore, is a unit, from whatever standpoint you view it. Just now [in this lecture], to us, this universe is a unit of Prana and &acirck&acircsha, force and matter. And mind you, like all other basic principles, this is also self-contradictory. For what is force? - that which moves matter. And what is matter? - that which is moved by force. It is a seesaw! Some of the fundamentals of our reasoning are most curious, in spite of our boast of science and knowledge... This state of things has been called Maya. It has neither existence nor non-existence. You cannot call it existence, because that only exists which is beyond time and space, which is self-existence. Yet this world satisfies to a certain degree our idea of existence. Therefore it has an apparent existence." />
