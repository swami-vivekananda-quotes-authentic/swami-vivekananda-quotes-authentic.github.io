All of us have heard of extraordinary happenings, and many of us have had some personal experience of them... Well, I saw many things like that. Going about India you find hundreds of similar things in different places. These are in every country. Even in this country [USA] you will find some such wonderful things. Of course there is a great deal of fraud, no doubt; but then, whenever you see fraud, you have also to say that fraud is an imitation. There must be some truth somewhere, that is being imitated; you cannot imitate nothing. Imitation must be of something substantially true." />
