"The less the thought of the body, the better. For it is the body that drags us down. It is attachment, identification, which makes us miserable. That is the secret: To think that I am the spirit and not the body, and that the whole of this universe with all its relations, with all its good and all its evil, is but as a series of paintings — scenes on a canvas — of which I am the witness."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Hints on Practical Spirituality" (Spiritual Breathing, Dec 29, 1899, Los Angeles Home of Truth), Complete Works: Vol 2
