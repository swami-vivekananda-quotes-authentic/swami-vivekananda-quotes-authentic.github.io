Here comes Miss So-and-so. She says, "I am going to be a Yogi." She tells the news twenty times, meditates fifty days, then she says, "There is nothing in this religion. I have tried it. There is nothing in it." The very basis [of spiritual life] is not there. The foundation [must be] this perfect morality. That is the great difficulty.
