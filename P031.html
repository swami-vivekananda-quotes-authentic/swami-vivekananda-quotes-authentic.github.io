"If we examine our own lives, we find that the greatest cause of sorrow is this: we take up something, and put our whole energy on it â€” perhaps it is a failure and yet we cannot give it up. We know that it is hurting us, that any further clinging to it is simply bringing misery on us; still, we cannot tear ourselves away from it. The bee came to sip the honey, but its feet stuck to the honey-pot and it could not get away. Again and again, we are finding ourselves in that state."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Work and Its Secret" (What Brings Success, Jan 4, 1900, Los Angeles, Complete Works: Vol 2)
