"The Karma-Yogi is the man who understands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and who also knows that this non-resistance is the highest manifestation of power in actual possession, and also what is called the resisting of evil is but a step on the way towards the manifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance. Before reaching this highest ideal, man's duty is to resist evil; let him work, let him fight, let him strike straight from the shoulder. Then only, when he has gained the power to resist, will non-resistance be a virtue."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Each Is Great in His Own Place" (Advanced karma yoga class, Dec 13, 1895, New York Vedanta Society), Karma Yoga, Complete Works: Vol 1
