"All the actions that we see in the world, all the movements in human society, all the works that we have around us, are simply the display of thought, the manifestation of the will of man. Machines or instruments, cities, ships, or men-of-war, all these are simply the manifestation of the will of man; and this will is caused by character, and character is manufactured by Karma. As is Karma, so is the manifestation of the will."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Karma in its Effect on Character" (Dec 13, 1895, New York Vedanta Society), Karma Yoga, Complete Works: Vol 1
