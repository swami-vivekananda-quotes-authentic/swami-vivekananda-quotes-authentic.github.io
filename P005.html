"Every mental and physical blow that is given to the soul, by which, as it were, fire is struck from it, and by which its own power and knowledge are discovered, is Karma, this word being used in its widest sense. Thus we are all doing Karma all the time. I am talking to you: that is Karma. You are listening: that is Karma. We breathe: that is Karma. We walk: Karma. Everything we do, physical or mental, is Karma, and it leaves its marks on us."<br><br>
- Swami Vivekananda, "Karma in its Effect on Character" (Dec 13, 1895, New York Vedanta Society), Karma Yoga, Complete Works: Vol 1
